# testingGround

### A small collection of Python Scripts

Note that the scripts here are often unreleated, unconnected, and perhaps not working.
This is more or less my development area as I learn Python, test new things, often times I just wanted a stand-alone dev enviroment for a specific function before I move that function over to it's intended app

### Some of the scripts that are here and their purpose:
- Security Sheaf Generator: A tool to automatically generate security sheafs for the tabletop RPG Shadowrun 3rd Edition
